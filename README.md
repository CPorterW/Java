# Overview

I wrote a Book of Mormon card game in Java. The goal of the game is to deplete your opponent's health while protecting your own. Currently, this game is pass and play, but I intend to add a bot opponent in the future. 

I made this game so that I could learn Java and make something interesting out of an idea I had. I want to extend this game big time, and maybe even incorporate it into another game I've been working on.
